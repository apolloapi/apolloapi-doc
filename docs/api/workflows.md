# Workflows & Rules

Once you've created your **Content Types** and **Actions**, you're ready to create your first rule!

Rules allow you to automate your Trust & Safety enforcement. When you send us content, we run it through all of your Rules, and those Rules can trigger Actions.

## How to Create a Rule

1. Navigate to the Rules tab
2. Click on the workflow you want
3. Enter a name, and optionally a description `If you're using our custom workflows engine`
4. Select which Content Types your Rule should run on - `If you're using our custom workflows engine`. We'll only ever run this Rule if we receive content that fits one of the Content Types you selected. For preset rules create Content Types first.
5. For `If you're using our custom workflows engine` - Construct your Rule's Conditions. Conditions are where the main logic of the Rule lives.
6. Click "Enable"
