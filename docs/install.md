# Installation

Before Apollo, testing model quality and automating workloads was time-consuming, with Apollo, you can simplify, accelerate and backtest the entire process. This makes it easier to train classifiers, handle real-time changes and make data driven decisions.

#### What you'll need

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3 or above:

```bash
pip install apollo-sdk
```
