# Why Apollo API?

Apollo enables you to protect your users from harm without writing code.

**You're on your way to building a powerful, custom Trust & Safety solution. Here are some things you'll want to check out.**

### How Apollo works

Apollo is a no-code platform for Trust & Safety. We have a few core products that allow you to build your entire Trust & Safety workflow extremely quickly:

- **Build Automated Rules Without Coding**: Create rules - without writing code - that automatically run on all your content and take action on abuse.
- **Use any Trust & Safety machine learning models**: In addition to offering some of our own ML models, Apollo integrates with all other Trust & Safety platforms so that you don't have to. Once you connect to Apollo, you get access to any other Trust & Safety service's machine learning models with the click of a button. And if you have your own custom models, you can integrate those into Apollo as well.
- **Manual Review Tool**: Some harmful content will inevitably slip through your automated Rules, and it'll get reported/flagged by your users. With our Manual Review Tool, your moderators can review those reports and take action on them directly in our UI.
- **Measurement/Evaluations**: We've built measurement and experimentation into the product so your data scientists and engineers don't have to.
