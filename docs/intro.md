# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Introduction

Let's discover **Apollo SDK in less than 2 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Apollo user interface (UI) is designed for creating decision making workflows. With Apollo platform, you can perform no-code AI tasks using the best engines in the market. Apollo SDK is a cli toolkit for developers to build automation pipelines on their own. Automate anything with the toolkit, UI is releasing soon!

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

### What you'll need

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3 or above:

## Show me an example of the SDK?

In your code you can write:

```python
Apollo.connect('postgres://username:password@hostnam...', ...) # Starts syncing content forever!

Apollo.use('OpenAI', "moderation", ...) # Connect to existing providers!

Apollo.rule('Phrase1', '>=', '0.8') # Create custom rules!

Apollo.use('Apollo', "violence", ...) # Connect with our internal models!

# Detect bad actors at scale!
Apollo.detectImage('Image1', 'contains', 'VERY_LIKELY') # Image Analysis/OCR
Apollo.detectSpeech('Audio1', 'contains', 'UNLIKELY') # Audio Processing
Apollo.detectVideo('Video1', 'contains', 'POSSIBLE') # Video Analysis
Apollo.detectText('Phrase1', 'contains', 'UNKNOWN') # Text Analysis

```

### Apollo then takes care of:

- Detecting real-time changes in user experience
- Automated detection against image, video, audio or text
- Connecting policy to product
- Making sure your integration is robust, so you never again have to worry about stuck/stale data or false-positives

### Cool, what can I build with it?

- Trust & Safety teams in companies use Apollo to **build native in-app connections** related to active response, content moderation, fraud detection, etc.
- Some **automate their personal lives** with Apollo by integrating against discord communities, or do other things. Checkout our [Features!](https://docs.apolloapi.io/docs/features)
- Apollo can help you **quickly build trust** for hobby projects, communities or business

[Let's try it!](https://docs.apolloapi.io/docs/api/quickstart)

...Self hosted user interface (UI) documentation coming soon.

## Neat, I would like to learn more
